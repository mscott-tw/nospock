- map with nulls
- 0 * _
- variable x that is used throughput the method must have type preserved so resolvedType() can be used to e.g. adjust types when passing arguments
- [p] reusable type adjustments base in different places, argument translation is adjusted for everything that has arguments
- [p] 'String asCode' -> 'Code asCode' with ability to reformat long lines in generic way
- var x = getX() <- does not derive x type to be getX() return value
- mocking outside test methods 
- assertThrows must be before verifications that depend on the call (replace when with assert, not throws(..))
